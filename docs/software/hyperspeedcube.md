[Release link]: https://github.com/HactarCE/Hyperspeedcube/releases/latest

It's recommended to download the Hyperspeedcube program (which is available on Windows, MacOS, and Linux), although a [web version](https://hypercubing.xyz/hyperspeedcube/) is available as well. The latest version is [![Release badge]][Release link] and can be downloaded from the website here:

[Download Hyperspeedcube](https://ajfarkas.dev/hyperspeedcube/){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

On Windows, it will download as a `.zip` file. After extracting the files and saving them to the destination of your choice, simply launch the `hyperspeedcube.exe` file. This *is* the program, so make sure you save it somewhere you can remember!

### Troubleshooting

??? warning "Windows: `download failed - virus detected`"
    If it immediately says `failed - virus detected` just after downloading, then your antivirus software thinks it is a virus. Try opening the Windows Security app, and digging around in the settings there to disable it, then try the download again.

??? warning "Windows: `Windows protected your PC`"
    If you get a message that says `Windows protected your PC` and it `prevented an unrecognized app from starting` after trying to run the `hyperspeedcube.exe` file for the first time, then click on the `more info` button, and then click `run anyway`.

??? warning "MacOS: `unidentified developer`"
    On MacOS, it might say: `"Hyperspeedcube" can not be opened because it is from an unidentified developer`. Try going to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > then click Allow next to where it says Hyperspeedcube is from an unidentified developer.

If you’re having other trouble with Hyperspeedcube, join the Hypercubers Discord server and ping @HactarCE or @Hyperspeedcube Developer.

## History/Development

Hyperspeedcube, or HSC, is the brainchild of Andrew Farkas (AKA HactarCE). Initially called Keyboard Speedcube and only supporting 3D Rubik's Cubes, the first screenshot was shared with the Hypercubers Discord on October 25th, 2021. A month later, Rowan Fortier asked Hactar if he could receive an early version of the program, and showcased it in a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn1y-3EMREQ).
