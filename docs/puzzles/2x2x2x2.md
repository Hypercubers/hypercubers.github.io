## History

The 2×2×2×2 (normally referred to as the 2^4^) is a 4-dimensional twisty puzzle in the shape of a hypercube that is cut in half on each of the 4 axes.

The first official 2^4^ solve on the [Hall of Fame](https://superliminal.com/cube/halloffame.htm) was done by [Jay Berkenbilt](https://www.ql.org/q/) in 2004 using [MC4D](/software/magiccube4d), although it was probably solved several times before that.

## Permutations

The 16 4cs of the 2×2×2×2 can be placed in any even permutation. In order to identify positions that are a whole-puzzle rotation apart from each other, we fix one 4c, leaving 15 4cs that can be permuted. Each 4c can be placed in $\frac{4!}{2}$ orientations, except the last, which can be placed in only $4$ orientations. Thus, the number of permutations of the puzzle is
$\frac{15!}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{4!}{2}\right)^{14} \cdot 4 \approx 3.36 \cdot 10^{27}.$
