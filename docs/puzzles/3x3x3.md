# 3×3×3

There's not much we can say about the traditional Rubik's cube that hasn't already been said on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube) or the [Speedsolving.com Wiki](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=Rubik%27s_cube_(puzzle_type)).

## 3×3×3 with 1D vision

What if you were a 2D being trying to solve a 3D Rubik's Cube? This is directly analogous to us 3D beings trying to solve a 4D cube, and [MagicCube3D](https://github.com/rzhao271/MC3D/) has a setting to view the 3×3×3 with 1D vision. The first known solver was [Markk](https://hypercubing.xyz/leaderboards/solvers/markk/) in December 2022.
