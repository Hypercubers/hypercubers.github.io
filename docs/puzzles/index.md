# Puzzles

Hypercubing is a fuzzy set that encompasses traditional cubing but focuses on exotic geometries and higher-dimensional spaces. This page lists and explains some hypercubing puzzles.

- Twisty puzzles in higher dimensions
- Puzzles on non-spherical tilings (hyperbolic, euclidean torus/klein)
- Puzzles on quotients of spherical space (e.g., hemimegaminx)
- Puzzles in normal spherical space, even if it's equivalent to a WCA puzzle (e.g., magictile megaminx)
- 3D sliding puzzles (e.g., 3D loopover)
- Exotic puzzle constructions (complex 3^3 and complex loopover)
- Other permutationish puzzles that are not included in traditional cubing (e.g., heav's relocation)
- Any permutationish puzzle in higher dimensions

Very few 4D puzzles have physical implementations, the major exception to this being the 2x2x2x2 through 3x3x3x3 hypercuboids. See [Physical puzzles](/puzzles/physical) for information on the currently existing and theoretical physical puzzles.

## 3x3x3 with 1D vision
What if you were a 2D being trying to solve a 3D Rubik's Cube? This is directly analagous to us 3D beings trying to solve a 4D cube, and [MagicCube3D](https://github.com/rzhao271/MC3D/releases/tag/v1.0.0) has a setting to view the 3x3x3 with 1D vision. The first known solver was [Markk](https://hypercubing.xyz/leaderboards/solvers/markk/) in December 2022.
