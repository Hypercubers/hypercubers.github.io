    **4D Shape:** Hypercuboid

    **Physical Shape:** Cube

    **Pieces:** 8 5c, 12 4c, 6 3c, 1 2c (2 1c)

    **Completed:** 2024 Jan 26

## History

Two days after finishing 3x3x2x1 (on 2023-01-26) [Tymon F](https://hypercubing.xyz/leaderboards/solvers/tymofro/) completed his final goal, creating physical analog of a 3x3x3x1 puzzle. To do this He had to assemble another four 4c pieces, 4 3c pieces and one 2c piece that represents two 1c pieces on virtual puzzle. This ended Tymon's jurney of creating physical puzzles from AxBxCx1 family.

## Moves

Legal moves of a layer include 3d 3x3x3 Rubik's cube 90° twists that rotate pieces without changing their 4d orientation, 4d 180° twists that beside moving pieces in 3d rotate them in 4d axis, or a combination of both.

## Solving

Beside basic stickers (white, yellow, orange, red, green, blue) every piece on a puzzle has pink and purle stickers which indcate in which 4d orientation the piece is. In solved state every piece must have the same 4d axis orientation.
3x3x3x1 is harder versioin of 3d Rubik's cube. Can be solved by: orienting 3c pieces in 4d axis, orienting 4c piece in 4d axis, orienting 5c pieces in 4d axis, except "OLL parity" (because of extra axis, single 5c can be missoriented) solving the rest of the puzzle like 3d Rubik's cube. Tymon made a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/CzwTSD_fCDY) explaining the puzzle as well as showing an example solve.
