## History

[Tymon F](https://hypercubing.xyz/leaderboards/solvers/tymofro/) began some initial tests for this puzzle in October 2023. The first 2 pieces were fully assembled and magnetized by December 2023. Finally (conincidentally exactly 1 year after he discovered hypercubing), Tymon completed the 2x2x2x1 hypercuboid on 2024-01-11. After that, he started work on creating the cuboids up to 3x3x3x1.

## Moves
