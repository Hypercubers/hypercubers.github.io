    **4D Shape:** Hypercuboid

    **Physical Shape:** Cuboid

    **Pieces:** 8 5c, 8 4c, 2 3c

    **Magnets:** 688

    **Completed:** 2024 Jan 24

## History

Over a week after completing physical 3x2x2x1 (on 2023-01-24) [Tymon F](https://hypercubing.xyz/leaderboards/solvers/tymofro/) finished assembling another four 4c pieces and two new 3c pieces that combined with 3x2x2x1 create physical 3x3x2x1 puzzle. This was the last mile stone on way to creating 3x3x3x1 puzzle.

## Moves

Legal moves of a layer include 3d 3x3x2 90° and 180° twists that rotate pieces without changing their 4d orientation, 4d 180° twists that beside moving pieces in 3d rotate them in 4d axis, or a combination of both.

## Solving

Beside basic stickers (white, yellow, orange, red, green, blue) every piece on a puzzle has pink and purle stickers which indcate in which 4d orientation the piece is. In solved state every piece must have the same 4d axis orientation.
3x3x2x1 puzzle is much more complicated than smaller hypercuboids. Can be solved by: orienting 3c pieces in 4d axis, orienting 4c piece in 4d axis, orienting 5c pieces in 4d axis, solving the rest of the puzzle like 3d 3x3x2. Tymon made a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/zJ13FI62GDE) showing example solve of the puzzle.
