    **4D Shape:** Hypercuboid

    **Physical Shape:** Cuboid

    **Pieces:** 8 5c, 8 4c, 2 3c

    **Magnets:** 688

    **Completed:** 2024 Jan 24

## History

Over a week after completing the physical 1×2×3×3, [Tymon F](https://hypercubing.xyz/leaderboards/solvers/tymofro/) finished assembling another four 4c pieces and two new 3c pieces that combined with the 1×2×3×3 to create the physical 1×2×3×3 puzzle. This was the last puzzle made with the goal of creating a physical 1×3×3×3.

## Moves

Legal moves of a layer include normal 2×3×3 90° and 180° twists that rotate pieces without changing their 4d orientation, 4d 180° twists that change the pink/purple stickers, or a combination of both.

## Solving

Besides basic stickers (white, yellow, orange, red, green, blue) every piece on the puzzle has pink and purple stickers which indicate in which 4d orientation the piece is. In the solved state every piece must have the same 4d axis orientation.
The 1×2×3×3 puzzle is much more complicated than smaller hypercuboids, but it can be solved by: orienting 3c pieces in 4d axis, orienting 4c piece in 4d axis, orienting 5c pieces in 4d axis, solving the rest of the puzzle like 3d 2×3×3. Tymon made a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/zJ13FI62GDE) showing an example solve of the puzzle.
