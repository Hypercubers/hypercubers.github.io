    **Pieces:** 32 5c

The Physical 2×2×2×2×2 (2^5^) is a valid design that represents its virtual counterpart, designed by Akkei, Grant, and Andreas. Unlike the [restricted 2×2×2×2×2](https://hypercubing.xyz/puzzles/physical/restricted-2x2x2x2x2/), this puzzle would have the full freedom and moves of the virtual puzzle.

## History

In the Hypercubers Discord, Akkei and Andreas were discussing how to represent the symmetries of a 5D 5c piece in 3D. They came upon a certain colouring of the rhombic triacontahedron that worked.

    I see

    **HHHHHHHHHMMMMMMMMM**

    I seeeee

Akkei quickly finished rendering the full puzzle, with all 32 pieces:

A few hours later, Grant figured out a simpler way to arrange the stickers that still worked:

And 2 days later, after an extensive vc discussion, he rendered this different version where the pieces are oriented in a more readable way:

This works because the rhombic triacontahedron can be viewed as 5 cubes circumscribed within it.
