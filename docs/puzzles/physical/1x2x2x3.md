    **4D Shape:** Hypercuboid

    **Physical Shape:** Cuboid

    **Pieces:** 8 5c, 4 4c

    **Magnets:** 512

    **Completed:** 2024 Jan 15

## History

Few days after completing physical 2x2x2x1 (on 2023-01-15) [Tymon F](https://hypercubing.xyz/leaderboards/solvers/tymofro/) finished assembling four new 4c pieces that combined with previous 5c pieces are creating a physical analog of 3x2x2x1 puzzle. This one was another important mile stone on way to creating 3x3x3x1 puzzle.

## Moves

Legal moves of a layer include 3d 3x2x2 90° and 180° twists that rotate pieces without changing their 4d orientation, 4d 180° twists that beside moving pieces in 3d rotate them in 4d axis, or a combination of both.

## Solving

Beside basic stickers (white, yellow, orange, red, green, blue) every piece on a puzzle has pink and purle stickers which indcate in which 4d orientation the piece is. In solved state every piece must have the same 4d axis orientation.
3x2x2x1 puzzle is a bit more complicated than 3x2x2. Can be solved by: orienting 4c piece in 4d axis, orienting 5c pieces in 4d axis, solving the rest of the puzzle like 3d 3x2x2. Tymon made a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/TytFuKXL_Xg) showing example solve of the puzzle.
