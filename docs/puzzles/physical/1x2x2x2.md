    **4D Shape:** Hypercuboid

    **Physical Shape:** Cube

    **Pieces:** 8 5c

    **Magnets:** 384

    **Completed:** 2024 Jan 11

## History

[Tymon F](https://hypercubing.xyz/leaderboards/solvers/tymofro/) began some initial tests for this puzzle in October 2023. The first 2 pieces were fully assembled and magnetized by December 2023. Finally (conincidentally exactly 1 year after he discovered hypercubing), Tymon completed the 2x2x2x1 hypercuboid on 2024-01-11. After that, he started work on creating the cuboids up to 3x3x3x1.

## Moves

Legal moves of a layer include basic 2x2x2 90° twists, 180° twists in any plane which also rotate pieces in 4d axis, or a combination of both.

## Solving

Beside basic stickers (white, yellow, orange, red, green, blue) every piece on a puzzle has pink and purle stickers which indcate in which 4d orientation the piece is. In solved state every piece must have the same 4d axis orientation.
2x2x2x1 puzzle is not much more difficult than 2x2x2. Can be solved by: orienting 5c pieces in 4d axis, except "OLL parity" (because of extra axis single 5c can be missoriented) the rest of the puzzle can be solved like a 3d 2x2x2. Tymon made a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/lkGgYKrKpi4) showing example solve of the puzzle.
