    - `Move count:` way too many

This method is Rowan Fortier's attempt to bring the [Roux method](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Roux_method) to the 3×3×3×3.

## Summary

1. `1st Block` — Solve a 1×2×3×3 block using blockbuilding techniques.
2. `2nd Block` — Solve a 1×2×3×3 block on the other side of the puzzle.
3. `CMLC` — Orient and permute the corners of the U cell.
4. `L/R` — Solve the Left and Right cells.
5. `M slice` - Permute the M slice.

## Steps

### 1st Block

Start with the "cross piece" of the 1st block. Then build four 2c3c and four 3c4c pairs around it, to complete the 1×2×3×3 block. No RKT is needed for this, as none of the other pieces have been solved yet.

### 2nd Block
Use the free M slice to help you build the pairs to make the 2nd 1×2×3×3 block on the opposite side of the puzzle from the 1st block.

### CMLC
Use the same strategies from [CFOP](/methods/3x3x3x3/cfop#4c-olc), but only for the 4C pieces. This step feels like solving the last cell of a 2^4^, except you have to use 3^4^ algorithms so that you don't mess up other pieces.

### L/R
Insert the UR and UL 2c pieces using setup moves and EPLL algorithms. Now set up the 3c pieces that need to go to L/R into the IDF spot with the L/R colour on the I cell and the U colour on the D cell. Then move the spot where that L/R edge needs to go above that edge and insert that piece using the RKT algorithm of M D2 M' D2 (2RO' IF' RO2 IF 2RO IF' RO2 IF). Repeat this for all of the edges (pretty tedious).

### M slice
Now all that's left to be solve is the M slice of the puzzle. Notice how the M slice is more like a 3^3^ than the [PLC](/methods/3x3x3x3/cfop#plc) of CFOP. The centers are already permuted too! However, this step is much more painful than normal RKT PLC due to the strange parities that can happen.

!!! warning "tricky situations"
    - A 3c piece can look "mirrored" in place.
    - A single 3c piece can be rotated wrong.
