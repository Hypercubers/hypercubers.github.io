# GRCL Method

The Grant Rowan Connor Luna method, or GRCL (pronounced "gurkle") is a combination of the best parts of several methods, including [Grant's OBC method](/methods/2x2x2x2-physical/grant.md), [Rowan's OBC method](/methods/2x2x2x2-physical/rowan.md), [Luna's cell blockbuilding technique](/methods/2x2x2x2-physical/luna.md), and Connor Lindsay's [P4L](/methods/2x2x2x2-physical/p4l.md) algorithms. The name GRCL was proposed by Hypercubers Discord member Jasper on July 18 2022.

## Steps
- Orient Both Cells using either Grant's method or Rowan's method (whatever looks better in that particular scramble)
- Separate the oriented colours of both cells while orienting 2 layers on those cells by holding the puzzle vertically and using Luna's method
- Permute both layers of both cells using Rowan's updated version of Connor's P4L algorithms
