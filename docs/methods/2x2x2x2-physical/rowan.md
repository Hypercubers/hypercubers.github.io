# Rowan's OBC Method for 2×2×2×2

Rowan developed this method for Orienting Both Cells while trying to solve the physical 2×2×2×2 for the first time in a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7w_Jn5oEwY).

## Steps

### Inspection

Before starting the solve, inspect the puzzle for an opposite colour pair that has 4 or fewer stickers oriented to the Left/Right axis (x-axis). They can be made of any colour in the colour pair, and can be in any spot on the puzzle.

### Getting 8 Oriented to Y-axis

Hold the puzzle vertically, and use block building to orient 8 pieces on a cell to the y-axis using the same colour pair that has 4 or less from inspection. This step is intuitive and does not require any [RKT](/techniques/rkt).

### Getting 12 Oriented to Y-axis

Now use RKT to orient a layer of 4 stickers on the other cell, leaving you with a "last layer" of 4 unoriented pieces on one of the cells.

### Fixing the Last Layer

Gyro the puzzle such that the 12 pieces that were oriented end up on the x-axis. Now you should have 4 (or fewer) stickers from that colour pair oriented in other directions besides the x-axis. All you need to do is use RKT to make it into a layer that looks like a possible [OCLL](https://jperm.net/algs/2x2/oll) case, not worrying about messing up the other 12 corners.

From here, gyro back. Now you will have a normal OCLL case that you can solve using RKT. After doing that algorithm, you should have all 16 corners oriented to the y-axis. Finally, you just gyro to put them all on the x-axis, and OBC is solved.

## Analysis

This technique takes more moves than other known OBC methods, and it uses up to 4 gyros. Besides the skip case where everything is already oriented, the best possible case for this technique uses 3 gyros, making it slower than other techniques. It also requires knowing the OCLL algorithms, which other techniques don't.
