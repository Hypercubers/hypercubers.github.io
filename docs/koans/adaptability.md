# Adaptability

_Hactar & Luna, 2024-04-15_

Neophyte Grigor had been learning under Master Yuwi for several months, strengthening his skills with the 3x3x3. Over time, he grew frustrated; he had come to the Temple of Intuition to learn to solve more exciting puzzles.

"Master Yuwi, thank you for your mentorship. You have taught me many new methods of solving a 3x3x3, but are these useful? I had already learned the method CFOP from the Temple of the Swift Solve, and could solve the cube in just 20 seconds. These new methods are slower and more confusing; what is their use?"

Master Yuwi nodded. "The techniques I have taught you are slower. Certainly your Method of the Swift Solve is superior." She then handed him an [Astroid Attack](https://twistypuzzles.com/app/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=1496). "I trust you can solve this using CFOP."

The neophyte stared at the puzzle for a moment. It was like nothing he had ever seen before. Certainly the Orientation and Permutation algorithms of CFOP would be of no use here. Nonetheless, when he applied the slower methods of [Commutators](/techniques/commutators.md) and Blockbuilding, he was able to completely solve the puzzle piece by piece. By the end, he had understood exactly the purpose of each and every move in his solution.

_At that moment, Grigor was enlightened._
