## What is hypercubing?

Hypercubing is the hobby of solving 4D+ puzzles in higher dimensions and exotic geometries.

### Isn't the 4th dimension time?

While time _is_ one dimension in 4D [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime), it behaves completely differently from the three spatial dimensions. Hypercubing deals with higher dimensions of space, where all dimensions are interchangeable.

### How can we visualize 4D?

Our eyes see only a 2D projection of the 3D world, and we're able to reconstruct the 3D world around us with only [minimal difficulty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_perspective). Using mathematics, we can project a 4D shape onto 3D, and then project that 3D shape onto 2D to be displayed on a computer screen. With enough practice, it's possible to reason intuitively about higher-dimensional space using these visualizations.

### Where can I interact with other hypercubers?

- The [Hypercubers Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7cdBEm49xQ) has the most active community of hypercubers and contains the latest updates on developing projects and speedsolving strategies.
- The [Hypercubing Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/hypercubing) is a good option for those who prefer mailing lists or less frequent updates.
- The [r/Hypercubers subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypercubers/) is mostly inactive.

Before the Google Group or Discord server, there was a Yahoo Groups mailing list. Those messages are [archived here](https://archive.hypercubing.xyz/).

## Virtual puzzles

### What program should I download?

It depends on what exactly you want to do, but generally, [Hyperspeedcube](https://ajfarkas.dev/hyperspeedcube/) and [MC4D](https://superliminal.com/cube/) will suit your needs. See the [software](/software) page for links to all the major programs.

### How do I start learning to solve 4D puzzles?

First, download [Hyperspeedcube](https://ajfarkas.dev/hyperspeedcube/) or MC4D and start experimenting with the 3^4^! Try to solve one-move scrambles and keep practicing that until you're comfortable. Once you can solve one-move scrambles with ease, pick a [method](/methods) to learn.

### Why not start with the 2x2x2x2?

The 2^4^ is particularly disorienting for beginners because half of the puzzle turns at once. As a result, while the 2^4^ strategy is technically simpler, it's actually more challenging to wrap your head around, especially when you're new to 4D puzzles. Just like how the 3^3^ is a better starting puzzle in 3D, you can learn lots of important concepts from the 3^4^ that will help you with other 4D puzzles.

### What methods exist for the 3x3x3x3?

Many 3D methods can just be scaled up and used on the 4D cube. Some notable methods are:

- [Layer-by-layer](https://youtu.be/h4n_QdZGXf8)
- [CFOP](/methods/3x3x3x3/cfop) — 4D CFOP
- [3Block](/methods/3x3x3x3/3block) — 4D FreeFOP, ~20% fewer moves compared to CFOP
- [Octachoroux](/methods/3x3x3x3/octachoroux) — 4D Roux, but awkward to use and contains many parity issues

Alternatively, join a voice chat on the [Hypercubers Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7cdBEm49xQ) and someone will teach you!

### What is God's number for \[puzzle\]?

See [God's Number](/theory/gods-number).

## Physical puzzles

### What is a physical 4D puzzle

The physical 4D puzzles are puzzles that are perfectly analogous to the virtual 4D puzzles, but implemented in the physical world. See these links:

- [Physical Puzzles](/puzzles/physical) on this site
- [Physical Puzzle](http://wiki.superliminal.com/wiki/Physical_Puzzle) on the Superliminal Wiki
- [Rowan Fortier's video about the history of physical hypercubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTc-rG-nunA)

### How do I buy a physical 2x2x2x2?

See the [Ordering Melinda's 2x2x2x2](https://superliminal.com/cube/2x2x2x2/ordering.html) on the Superliminal website. Also see [Melinda's 2x2x2x2](https://superliminal.com/cube/2x2x2x2/) on the Superliminal site, which includes the history, statistics, and Hall of Fame.

### How do I buy another physical puzzle?

Melinda's 2^4^ is currently the only physical puzzle for sale. The physical 3^4^ and hypercuboids are currently one-of-a-kind. If you want you, you need to design and 3D print it yourself.

### What physical 4D puzzles have been built?

See [Physical Puzzles](/puzzles/physical) for a comprehensive list.

### What physical 4D puzzles are possible?

While it's always possible to just arrange the stickers on a table, the real challenge is in finding a design that is piece-based instead of sticker-based and fits in a compact shape that isn't too horrendous to turn. This requires some out-of-the-box thinking and, in extreme cases, application of group theory. We currently have several renderings for physical puzzles that haven't been built in real life yet; see the [Physical Puzzles](/puzzles/physical) page for an incomplete list.

## Speedsolving

### What are the speedsolving records for 4D puzzles?

See the [leaderboards](/leaderboards). To get on the leaderboard, read the [submission guidelines](/leaderboards/rules) and submit a video of your solve to [this form](https://forms.gle/Y7Vpi3pb8989Ay8W8).

### Why not use speedrun.com?

Speedrun.com does not allow "generic Rubik's Cube simulators." We applied and were rejected.

### I don't know full OLL/PLL/ZBLL/etc. Can I still get fast at 4D?

Absolutely! Most 4D speed methods are highly intuitive, and world-record times often use just 2-look OLL and PLL. Executing algorithms is a very negligible part of the solve compared to the massive amounts of pair or block building.

### What 4D algorithms are there?

There's so many cases for each step of the solve that creating a complete algorithm set is basically impossible, and there's so many options for moves that algorithm explorers are infeasible. Almost every algorithm we have is based on an algorithm from 3D, and the only search program we have is a sort of optimizer for one very specific kind of algorithm derived from 3D.

## Does this puzzle exist?

### 4D Square-1

Square-1 is fundamentally a bandaged dodecagonal prism. There are so many ways to extend that into 4D that there isn't really a canonical "4D square-1"

### 4D Skewb

Again, there's lots of ways to generalize a skewb. If you just want cuts that look like a skewb, there's a few different puzzles that emulate that. If you want a half-cut vertex-turning hypercube, that's a thing too! It just doesn't "look like" a traditional skewb. For more 4D skewbs, including pictures, see [here](/puzzles/4d-skewb).

### 8-dimensional and higher

Above 5 dimensions, cube puzzles aren't more difficult or interesting, just more tedious and computationally expensive. But there might be some wild hyperpuzzles yet to be discovered up there, say one based on the very special geometry of the [E8 Lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E8_lattice)!

### 3D Rubik's Clock

Instead of rotating circles in 2D, you can rotate spheres in 3D. This is a more interesting puzzle than the traditional Rubik's Clock because moves don't commute. No one's written a program yet to simulate it but you totally could!

### How do I make a 4D \[thing\]?

**:sparkles: Generalising Things to 4D: A Handy Guide :sparkles:**

1. Understand and define the thing you're generalising
2. Find where your definitions reference or assume something dimension-specific
3. Rewrite your definitions to avoid dimension-specific references or assumptions
4. Find what 4D object fits your new definitions (there may be one, several, or none)
